            The most crucial thing about all below is that is comprised of chronological layers & must
            be approached with a slightly archaeological frame of mind, as with most online traces
        </p>

        <p>
            If the fact of existence seems like a broadly cruel thing to you (or you feel like a despicable thing among
            the otherwise respectable existence of the broader world), & you have never made a point of conceiving of
            yourself as a person with trauma, or have markedly shied away from the idea (perhaps out of the sense that
            it is a “dramatic” thing existing beyond the scope of your banal suffering or dissatisfaction), I am here to
            suggest (with forceful insistence behind these words) that for you to go out on the limb of making trauma
            part of your framework of self-understanding may be one of the most important doors you ever walk through in
            your whole life! You may even have the chance of going through this door quite earlier than I managed to
        </p>

        <p>
            Perhaps you may be like I was for a long time, unconsciously craving the explanatory power of a trauma-based
            framework but unwilling to “co-opt” the phenomenon of trauma until I felt more certain about it. I might
            have been fascinated to read the words which follow: “I am demanding that you just try out having trauma &
            see where it takes you”
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, I cannot say it will be appropriate to the case of everyone who reads this & I do not want to
            wantonly dangle a panacea or skeleton key in front of anyone. If I could, I would write this post with the
            perfect balance of insistence towards those it might benefit, & acknowledgment that it won’t benefit
            everyone. No chance of false negatives or false positives. I can’t write perfectly write a wholly public
            post like that, though
        </p>

        <p>
            Nor can I be sure that this suggestion will necessarily lead straight down the most superficially pleasant
            or relieving roads for those to whom it may be applicable. But it is what I am typing here all the same. &
            consider the book Complex PTSD by Pete Walker
        </p>

        <p>===</p>

        <p>
            Foundational to my way of experiencing things is the sense that “bird” is our name for an event, but an
            event we tend to experience not as an event but as an object, & an agent. We look at a bird & see a thing of
            apparent stability & coherent perspective, as it hops around, eats at seeds, hops from branch to branch. But
            consider: a bird is a thing with a start point, a duration, a path, & an end point, a calculable average
            speed between a beginning & an end. So what can you call it but an event, no different from dropping a stone
            off a balcony? A bird is a collusion of proteins & minerals - the skeleton made of very committed ones,
            while the skin cells are made of very itinerant ones. They all work together to spend some time facilitating
            the event that is a bird
        </p>

        <p>
            In childhood, of course I would identify with the bird & wonder about the world through its eyes. I would
            see it as a subject & an agent. But I am grown now, & it’s sort of like that healthy subject who was my
            younger self, who recognized the bird as a fellow subject, has gone away. Now, often, the bird is just the
            object that it secretly always was. & sometimes I just feel like an object too. I’ll say to myself,
            self-empathize or don’t, identify with your own frame of reference or don’t, do what you will, whatever
            happens will happen all the same. Life is only an event, no longer lived, only witnessed. &, if riding in a
            car, never do I feel the character of its interior, the sense it holds as a space I occupy. I only feel its
            progression through space, its expenditure of gasoline, & the global economy’s march towards peak oil
        </p>

        <p>
            & you might mistake me for someone who views this as a necessarily positive change, a recognition of truth -
            “ever useful truth.” But that is not really the case. What does it matter, in the grand scheme of things, if
            I live as a subject or an object? Certainly it was more comfortable to be a subject, so I would prefer that.
            I would like to be a subject again. & sometimes I guess I am, sometimes I enjoy the antics of the bird in
            the grass in that old way. But not always. Sometimes I am just an object to extents that are completely
            piercing & defining & total. Sometimes I hazard the guess that maybe you get to be a subject again once you
            do the work of unraveling all your personal traumas, but what do I know?
        </p>

        <p>
            Do children tend to be subjects, & adults objects? What’d be the figure for a census of adult subjects in
            the world at this moment? Is the desire to be a subject really just that old song & dance of futile longing
            for the past? Well, I don’t know. No clue, folks
        </p>

        <p>
            If there is any delight to be drawn from this overall thought, it’s what I’ve been saying lately: the
            process by which many of the knots in one’s mind pleasantly untangle is a sum of forces which one cannot
            halt even if they try, your gradual self-understanding is inscribed preemptively into the world around you &
            into its laws, this makes that pleasantness essential to living. There is no wrong path, you are on the
            path. Know the momentum of the planet’s orbit is behind your back. Try not to let this embolden your ego’s
            possible inclinations toward anything truly unwise or unkind, though. Do your best
        </p>

            I don't update anything on this account very much lately. I'm still an alive thing whereas this account is a
            dead thing. Not "dead" as in "inactive" but rather dead in the way that anything written or collated is dead
            from the moment of its creation, a trace of one moment of an alive thing. Each facet of this account, at the
            moments of its creation, expressed some truth about the alive thing at that moment (whether an undisguised
            truth or some transformed or sublimated form of it). Now, with most of those traces being in the past, they
            maintain varying degrees of truthful connection to the present. Some endure more than others. The alive
            thing will never be contained in a webpage, as much as I wish it could. Then it would be very easy to be
            known completely. Maybe some things which are truths for my past self & half-truths or untruths for my
            present self will nonetheless be truths for your present self. If you enjoy any contents of this account I
            hope you can identify any outright untruth I may have made the mistake of fossilizing here & not accept it
            into yourself... not factual untruth but abstract, spiritual untruth. Which is subjective, but I'm
            pretending it's not. Basically, what I am saying with this paragraph is... don't get it twisted!

            Cool obsolete paragraph for you to read: my Discord is tag apple#4303 (I have tenaciously hung onto my
            numerical identifier, at the cost of being stuck eternally as an apple - a tale as old as time). If you want
            to talk to me, you should. Something good or at least on the good side of neutral might happen, & there is
            no chance that anything bad will happen. I don't know that anyone wants to talk to me or will want to talk
            to me, but that sentence is what I would want to read if I wanted to talk to someone, so I leave it there
            just in case

            You only get one review per album. Why go down it like a checklist? If this is your officiated "place" to
            write it then you only get one time with that album on your official stage. What is the album supposed to
            provoke you to write? Be careful. But not so careful that it is boring! ...be careful!

            A person is not separable from the broader reality they come from, the notion of a person is only a product
            of the folly of our compulsive gestalt perception, a person is a protrusion of water from a sea of water,
            but then it can only be called a protrusion if we draw a circle around a certain apparent geometry & call it
            “protrusion.” Love is the places within reality where it connects with itself, although this is meaningless
            to say since it is single & only connected with itself from the outset. It’s only our gestalt perception
            which claims otherwise, drawing circles over supposed constituent elements

            would be even
            less possible for it to present itself for what it is in such a perfectly rigorous manner that stupidity
            & bad faith
            would be forbidden among everyone who had anything to do with it, & in such a way that a universal
            lesson
            would be imposed upon everyone. Such an idealist pretension can only support itself through a dogmatism

            thought"

            "The impulse to water down feelings & consequently declare oneself "mature" is a deadening, cheapening,
            & unethical approach to life. Rationality, self-knowledge, & clarity of mind are in no sense
            antithetical to intensity. & resisting the latter is certainly not a good path to any of the former. ...
            [l]ove isn't some kind of passive entertainment or fleeting hunger; love involves serious ontological
            reconfigurations. Or at least there's a thing that happens, when you grow to know a person, when that
            person is smart, creative, & kind, when they can surprise you, see the same things you can see, & behave
            with either such compassion or regularity that you can relax your shields around them, where they become
            qualitatively more real to you. Almost as real as yourself. Where your mirror neurons jiggle & dance in
            tune with them, a ghost of them moving alongside you at all times. Loving someone remakes yourself. But
            most importantly, even if that ghost fades to a silent unnoticed echo, the impression left by the
            experience reshapes your ethical reality. You are not alone. Tangibly. Provably. There are other minds.
            In a way impossible to ascertain merely kicking balls with the shrieking automatons on the playground or
            banging one in a bathroom or being overcome with the novelty of a new automaton with handsome
            hydraulics. & this implies an absolute ethical obligation

        <p>
            There is something uniquely convincing about the perceptions that occur to you when you are in love.
            They seem truer than other perceptions, & more truly your own, won from reality at personal cost.
            Greatest certainty is felt about the beloved as necessary complement to you. Your powers of imagination
            connive at this vision, calling up possibilities from beyond the actual. All at once a self never known
            before, which now strikes you as the true one, is coming into focus. A gust of godlikeness may pass
            through you & for an instant a great many things look knowable, possible & present. Then the edge
            asserts itself. You are not a god. You are not that enlarged self. Indeed, you are not even a whole
            self, as you now see.

            ...& when I say 'dying of love'" - qfwfq went on - "I mean something you have no idea of, because you
            think falling in love has to signify falling in love with another person, or thing or what have you, in
            other words I'm here & what I'm in love with is there, in short a relationship connected to the life of
            relationships, whereas I'm talking about the times before I had established any relationships between
            myself & anything else, there was a cell & the cell was me, & that was that. Now we needn't wonder
            whether there were other cells around too, it doesn't matter, there was the cell that was me & it was
            already quite an achievement, such a thing is more than enough to fill one's life, & it's this very
            sense of fullness I want to talk to you about. I don't mean fullness because of the protoplasm I had,
            because even if it had increased to a considerable degree it wasn't anything exceptional, cells of
            course are full of protoplasm, what else could they be full of; no, I'm talking about a sense of
            fullness that was, if you'll allow the expression, quote spiritual unquote, namely the awareness that
            this cell was me, this sense of fullness, this fullness of being aware was something that kept me awake
            nights, something that made me beside myself, in other words the situation I mentioned before, I was
            'dying of love.'
        </p>

        <p>
            At the end of Faust, Goethe was already asserting that "the eternal feminine takes us Above." I'm sorry,
            but I find such statements rather obscene. Love doesn't take me 'above' or indeed 'below.' It is an
            existential project: to construct a world from a decentred point of view other than that of my mere
            impulse to survive or re-affirm my own identity. ... Here, I am opposing 'construction' to 'experience.'
            When I lean on the shoulder of the woman I love, & can see, let's say, the peace of twilight over a
            mountain landscape, gold-green fields, the shadow of trees, black-nosed sheep motionless behind hedges &
            the sun about to disappear behind craggy peaks, & know - not from the expression on her face, but from
            within the world as it is - that the woman I love is seeing the same world, & that this convergence is
            part of the world & that love constitutes precisely, at that very moment, the paradox of an identical
            difference, then love exists, & promises to continue to exist. The fact is she & I are now incorporated
            into this unique Subject, the Subject of love that views the panorama of the world through the prism of
            our difference, so this world can be conceived, be born, & not simply represent what fills my own
            individual gaze. Love is always the possibility of being present at the birth of the world
        </p>

        <p>
            So unlike love, politics is all about a confrontation between enemies?
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, you know, look, in love, at the absolute difference that exists between two individuals, one of
            the biggest differences one can imagine, given that it is an infinite difference, yet an encounter, a
            declaration & fidelity can transform that into a creative existence. Nothing of the sort can happen in
            politics in terms of the basic contradictions, the upshot being that in effect there are clearly
            designated enemies. A central issue in political thought is the question of enemies & it is very
            difficult to deal with today, in part because of the democratic framework within which we operate. The
            issue is: do enemies exist? I mean by that, real enemies. A real enemy is not someone you are resigned
            to see take power periodically because lots of people voted for him. That is a person you are annoyed to
            see as head of State because you would have preferred his adversary. & you will wait your turn, for five
            or ten years or more. An enemy is something else: an individual you won’t tolerate taking decisions on
            anything that impacts on yourself. So do real enemies exist or not? That should be our starting-point.
            It is an extremely important issue in politics & one we are too quick to push to one side
        </p>

        <p>
            The issue of the enemy is completely foreign to the question of love. In love, you can find hurdles, be
            haunted by immanent dramas, but there are in fact, no enemies. One might object: what about my rival?
            The person my lover prefers to me? Well, that is an entirely totally different matter. In politics, the
            struggle against the enemy constitutes the action. The enemy forms part of the essence of politics.
            Genuine politics identifies its real enemy. However, the rival remains absolutely external, he isn’t
            part of the definition of love. On this point I disagree profoundly with all those who think that
            jealousy is a constituent element of love. The most brilliant representative of the latter is Proust,
            for whom jealousy is the real, intense, demonic content of amorous subjectivity. In my opinion, this is
            simply a variant of the thesis of the skeptical moralists. Jealousy is a fake parasite that feeds on
            love & doesn’t at all help to define it. Must every love identify an external rival before it can
            declare itself, before it can begin? No way!
        </p>

        <p>
            The reverse is the case: the immanent difficulties of love, the internal contradictions of the Two scene
            can crystallize around a third party, a rival, imagined or real. The difficulties love harbors don’t
            stem from the existence of an enemy who has been identified. They are internal to the process: the
            creative play of difference. Selfishness, not any rival, is love’s enemy. One could say: my love’s main
            enemy, the one I must defeat, is not the other, it is myself, the “myself” that prefers identity to
            difference, that prefers to impose its world against the world re-constructed through the filter of
            difference

            There is no escape. You can't be a vagabond & an artist & still be a solid citizen, a wholesome,
            upstanding man. You want

            to get drunk, so you have to accept the hangover. You say yes to the sunlight & pure fantasies, so you
            have to say yes to the filth & the nausea. Everything is within you, gold & mud, happiness & pain, the
            laughter of childhood & the apprehension of death. Say yes to everything, shirk nothing. Don't try to
            lie to yourself. You are not a solid citizen. You are not a Greek. You are not harmonious, or the master
            of yourself. You are a bird in the storm. Let it storm! Let it drive you! How much have you lied! A
            thousand times, even in your poems & books, you have played the harmonious man, the wise man, the happy,
            the enlightened man. In the same way, men attacking in war have played heroes, while their bowels
            twitched. My God, what a poor ape, what a fencer in the mirror man is- particularly the artist-
            particularly myself!

            Today Americans are overcome not by the sense of endless possibility but by the banality of the social
            order they have erected against it. Having internalized the social restraints by means of which they
            formerly sought to keep possibility within civilized limits, they feel themselves overwhelmed by an
            annihilating boredom, like animals whose instincts have withered in captivity. A reversion to savagery
            threatens them so little that they long precisely for a more vigorous instinctual existence. People
            nowadays complain of an inability to feel. They cultivate more vivid experiences, seek to beat sluggish
            flesh to life, attempt to revive jaded appetites. They condemn the superego & exalt the lost life of the
            senses. Twentieth-century people have erected so many psychological barriers against strong emotion, &
            have invested those defenses with so much of the energy derived from forbidden impulse, that they can no
            longer remember what it feels like to be inundated by desire. They tend, rather, to be consumed with
            rage, which derives from defenses against desire & gives rise in turn to new defenses against rage
            itself. Outwardly bland, submissive, & sociable, they seethe with an inner anger for which a dense,
            overpopulated, bureaucratic society can devise few legitimate outlets

            When I think about how literally every feature or facet of modern life works if even inadvertantly to
            diminish any amount & expression of some underlying human or natural spirit I just want to kms. Its
            basically all gone. Of course its still latent in some ways, but recognizing it & embracing it appears
            completely foreign to most people. I dont think this is at all a bad thing to do, & maybe im a bit
            misguided by melodrama, but the fact that we basically have to "teach" people to wonder & be in awe of
            things fucks me up so much, because im convinced that everyone's meant to appear in the world in one way
            or another predisposed to wonder, love, appreciate things, nature, life god etc. It feels like its been
            beaten out to such a degree that disposition towards these things can only be understood & manifest in a
            highly diluted technical, caricatured form. Theres an underlying earnestness & authenticity to them
            thats lost in so many different ways, under a thousand layers of pseudo profundity & media instilled
            archetypes. For example, I think you can in some sense teach the appreciation of art. But even if this
            can surpass all these confounding obstacles & caricatures (e.g. pretentious academic, museums & their
            history, cutlural media portrayal of pseudo obscurantists etc), theres a sense in which its lost
            completely if it ever had to be taught, especially via theory & aesthetics. Theres this false sense of
            pride that everything can be grasped in this way, as if nothing spiritual in the real sense could
            underlie things, that fucking disgusts me. This is even worse w things concerning the appreciation of
            life in general. & I refuse to believe that me or anyone else is relatively unique in this respect, that
            jsut some a predisposed towards these things, since there are glimpses of them in everyone even if
            rarely. But you cant even communicate this to someone for whom it is foreign, because all the words you
            use to do so just evaporate into thin air when you speak. Theres too many connotations preventing it
            from being communicated to them. & the whole point is that it cant be appropriated by your language
            anyway, not perfectly at least, & so when its beaten out so early & often from people theres a sense in
            which its totally lost as theyre born into a world hostile to even the smallest amount of it. No I wont
            elaborate this, because honestly if you get it you get it/feel it

            Worst of all is that, having colonized almost every known corner of reality, capitalism convinces us
            that life itself is what's awful. Which would be so much easier to believe, relinquishing us from the
            added strain of imagining what possibilities might lie beyond the existent. But some things can never be
            fully ground down, some truths - physiological rather than intellectual - never quite forgotten. As
            children, everything was so different: we promised ourselves we'd never become old, nor surrender our
            dreams. With the passing of time, though, those joyous days, in which all activity was but a
            modification of play, somehow receded into the distant past. Hammered out of us by the banality of
            routine, & the violence of constant stress, that youthful wisdom - the unashamed passion with which we
            approached every conceivable issue - slowly withered & died. As adults, most of us have totally forsaken
            the preciousness of life - not merely our own lives as individuals, but also of life itself. Yet it can
            always be rediscovered. Lying within each of us is a dormant truth, something so terrible, so
            revolutionary, that it threatens to demolish everything that makes the 21st century such a wretched
            affair: life is not merely something to get through

            Of course one might make a film about it. But even if such a film succeeded in being as fundamentally
            incoherent & unsatisfying as the reality it dealt with, it could never be more than a re-creation — as
            impoverished & false as this botched tracking shot
        </p>

        <p>
            Chatel thinks that if a portion of the population recognizes itself in a film, it will be able to “look
            at itself, admire itself, criticize itself or reject itself — in any case, to use the images that pass
            on the screen for its own needs.” Let us first of all note that there is a certain mystery in this
            notion of using such a flow of images to satisfy authentic needs. Just how they are to be used is not
            clear. It would first of all seem to be necessary to specify which needs are in question in order to
            determine whether those images can really serve as means to satisfy them. Furthermore, everything we
            know about the mechanism of the spectacle, even at the simplest cinematic level, absolutely contradicts
            this idyllic vision of people equally free to admire or criticize themselves by recognizing themselves
            in the characters of a film
        </p>

        <p>
            But most fundamentally, it is impossible to accept this division of labor between uncontrollable
            specialists presenting a vision of people’s lives to them & audiences having to recognize themselves
            more or less clearly in those images. Attaining a certain accuracy in describing people’s behavior is
            not necessarily positive. Even if Godard presents people with an image of themselves in which they can
            undeniably recognize themselves more than in the films of Fernandel, he nevertheless presents them with
            a false image in which they recognize themselves falsely

            Revolution is not “showing” life to people, but bringing them to life. A revolutionary organization must
            always remember that its aim is not getting its adherents to listen to convincing talks by expert
            leaders, but getting them to speak for themselves, in order to achieve, or at least strive toward, an
            equal degree of participation

            along those lines? It's that everybody's got- everybody's capable- got a Phenomenology of Spirit

            Valdrada’s inhabitants know that each of their actions is, at once, that action & its mirror-image,
            which possesses the special dignity of images, & this awareness prevents them from forgetfulness. Even
            when lovers twist their naked bodies, skin against skin, seeking the position that will give one the
            most pleasure in the other, even when murderers plunge the knife into the black veins of the neck & more
            clotted blood pours out the more they press the blade that slips between the tendons, it is not so much
            their copulating or murdering that matters as the copulating or murdering of the images, limpid & cold
            in the mirror
        </p>

        <p>
            At times the mirror increases a thing’s value, at times denies it. Not everything that seems valuable
            above the mirror maintains its force when mirrored. The twin cities are not equal, because nothing that
            exists or happens in Valdrada is symmetrical: every face & gesture is answered, from the mirror, by a
            face & gesture inverted, point by point. The two Valdradas live for each other, their eyes interlocked;
            but there is no love between them

        <p>
            Thus it is that the lovers conspire to protect each other from the lethal destiny of their passion,
            either succeeding in this, & relapsing into the wretched sanity of mutual affection, or compacting their
            fever to new scratch-patches of intensity

            For years I could not accept the place I was in. I felt I should be somewhere else. A city, trees, human
            voices lacked the quality of presence. I would live by the hope of moving on. Somewhere else there was a
            city of real presence, of real trees and voices and friendship and love.

            You who never arrived in my arms, Beloved, who were lost from the start, I don't even know what songs
            would please you. I have given up trying to recognize you in the surging wave of the next moment. All
            the immense images in me - the far-off, deeply felt landscape, cities, towers, and bridges, and un-
            suspected turns in the path, and those powerful lands that were once pulsing with the life of the gods -
            all rise within me to mean you, who forever elude me. You, Beloved, who are all the gardens I have ever
            gazed at, longing. An open window in a country house - and you almost stepped out, pensive, to meet me.
            Streets that I chanced upon, - you had just walked down them and vanished. And sometimes, the mirrors
            were still dizzy with your presence and, startled, gave back my too-sudden image. Who knows? perhaps the
            same bird echoed through both of us yesterday, separate, in the evening...

            During the early fall of her twenty-seventh year a passionate restlessness took possession of Alice. She
            could not bear to be in the company of the drug clerk, & when, in the evening, he came to walk with her
            she sent him away. Her mind became intensely active & when, weary from the long hours of standing behind
            the counter in the store, she went home & crawled into bed, she could not sleep. With staring eyes she
            looked into the darkness. Her imagination, like a child awakened from long sleep, played about the room.
            Deep within her there was something that would not be cheated by phantasies & that demanded some
            definite answer from life
        </p>

        <p>
            Alice took a pillow into her arms & held it tightly against her breasts. Getting out of bed, she
            arranged a blanket so that in the darkness it looked like a form lying between the sheets &, kneeling
            beside the bed, she caressed it, whispering words over & over, like a refrain. "Why doesn't something
            happen? Why am I left here alone?" she muttered. Although she sometimes thought of Ned Currie, she no
            longer depended on him. Her desire had grown vague. She did not want Ned Currie or any other man. She
            wanted to be loved, to have something answer the call that was growing louder & louder within her
        </p>

        <p>
            & then one night when it rained Alice had an adventure. It frightened & confused her. She had come home
            from the store at nine & found the house empty. Bush Milton had gone off to town & her mother to the
            house of a neighbor. Alice went upstairs to her room & undressed in the darkness. For a moment she stood
            by the window hearing the rain beat against the glass & then a strange desire took possession of her.
            Without stopping to think of what she intended to do, she ran downstairs through the dark house & out
            into the rain. As she stood on the little grass plot before the house & felt the cold rain on her body a
            mad desire to run naked through the streets took possession of her

            She thought that the rain would have some creative & wonderful effect on her body. Not for years had she
            felt so full of youth & courage. She wanted to leap & run, to cry out, to find some other lonely human &
            embrace him. On the brick sidewalk before the house a man stumbled homeward. Alice started to run. A
            wild, desperate mood took possession of her. "What do I care who it is. He is alone, & I will go to
            him," she thought; & then without stopping to consider the possible result of her madness, called
            softly. "Wait!" she cried. "Don't go away. Whoever you are, you must wait"
        </p>

        <p>
            The man on the sidewalk stopped & stood listening. He was an old man & somewhat deaf. Putting his hand
            to his mouth, he shouted. "What? What say?" he called
        </p>

        <p>
            Alice dropped to the ground & lay trembling. She was so frightened at the thought of what she had done
            that when the man had gone on his way she did not dare get to her feet, but crawled on hands & knees
            through the grass to the house. When she got to her own room she bolted the door & drew her dressing
            table across the doorway. Her body shook as with a chill & her hands trembled so that she had difficulty
            getting into her nightdress. When she got into bed she buried her face in the pillow & wept
            brokenheartedly. "What is the matter with me? I will do something dreadful if I am not careful," she
            thought, & turning her face to the wall, began trying to force herself to face bravely the fact that
            many people must live & die alone, even in Winesburg
        </p>

            The only very real love in the world is a hollowed spectrum visible in every colliding orb of blood &
            dust. It goes without saying, but selfless love is infinitely transcendentally boundless. Brotherhood
            isn't the ocean or the archipelago; it's the basic building block of civilization. There is evil in the
            dark, there is innocence in the light, there is love in the presence of horror. You know the things you
            love the most but can't physically hold them all? Holding them in your mind, deep in your gut, somewhere
            deep inside you can feel them leaking from? Holding them like this, in these moments of brokenness,
            while you've held them all? Holding them like this. She's like a woodpecker, she picks up the smallest
            sand & dust particles, burrowed her fingers into the crystals, to peer into their burning, to see their
            lode sparking bright. All muses are born with imperfect opposites, dormant. Generation after generation
            suffers, for "not the right sort of man" "the wrong kind of marriage" "the wrong sort of child" "the
            wrong person to wed in love!"

            The reason I am painstakingly preparing a charcuterie & leaving it in the fridge for when you wake up
            hungry tomorrow is actually quite simple. It is because I love you very much /// you're laughing. I told
            you a joke & you're laughing. I love you /// yk when someone's telling a joke but they keep stopping
            because they're laughing too hard & then you start laughing even though you don't know what for or
            why......love

            The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here,
            the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape
            suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno & become such a part of it that you can no
            longer see it. The second is risky & demands constant vigilance & apprehension: seek & learn to
            recognize who & what, in the midst of the inferno, are

            not inferno, then make them endure, give them space
        </p>

        <p>
            It's just really awesome to be in each other's company because it feels so... it feels so "pure", like
            we are the fox & the hound, or two five-year-old children
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the ending where you finally find your way home & the ancient terror inside of you is stomped
            out for good

            distinguished from the soul; animal o; carnality. v. flesh; pr: par., fleshing; ooff. o: adj. fleshless,
            fleshly, fleshy. FLESH'MEAT. s. Animal food; the flesh ... Sham dustbathing raises an interesting
            question in animal behaviour, motivation & welfare. Hens that have been reared in captivity without ever
            having encountered litter will perform sham dustbathing. Therefore, it can be questioned how these
            birds, which have never had the possibility to dustbathe in a functional substrate, perceive sham
            dustbathing; do they yearn for something that they have never had or known (i.e. litter), or are they
            content to sham dustbathe? A connecting thread, an inner rule, a perspective, a discourse. With cities,
            it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a
            rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires & fears,
            even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, &
            everything conceals something else. The point at which that particular dynamism found its purest
            incarnation in matter, the point at which it was freest from interference from other modes & rose to its
            highest degree of intensity. That never lasts more than a flash, because the world rarely leaves room
            for uncommon intensity, being in large measure an entropic trashbin of outworn modes that refuse to die.
            Explicit spaces like user pages & group chats which conceal more abstract but still definitely existing
            spaces whose borders are marked by finely varying concentrations of widely varying signals, each
            parallel to many other undifferentiated signals, & the whole of the signals being perpendicular to the
            explicit spaces & passing through their borders… this all ultimately just being analogous to, a map of,
            the social characteristics of the people using the internet. There is no need for you to leave the
            house. Stay at your table & listen. Don’t even listen, just wait. Don’t even wait, be completely quiet &
            alone. The world will offer itself to you to be unmasked; it can’t do otherwise; in raptures it will
            writhe before you. Our car broke down in the following eight places, & each place had a nice new friend,
            a sunny ditch, a kooky animal, & a romantic feeling

            The four am felt in need of spontaneously exiting the apartment & sprinting in the direction of the
            nearest major street without the burden of a purse or a phone or what-have-you. Well, I certainly did
            all I needed to do. Although I'd like people to fully understand, it was naturally all too spontaneous &
            freeform to bother reasonably committing to text, I tried to make it artistic like a performance for
            myself, I kept telling myself to keep the energy going, you simply would have had to have been there to
            know the flavor. It was cooler than I expected, humid yes but not balmy, & the clouds were low so that
            they were wonderfully lit up. Running, stopping & feeling my body burningly push oxygen into less
            supplied areas, dancing down the middle of empty streets, spinning as I run, skipping, stomping,
            windmilling arms & falling & lying on the asphalt parking lot behind the church & thinking about how
            easy it is to break the routines & patterns at every second as this mindset begins to truly take me then
            taking off down the next street, petting a cat, ranting to myself, topics too freeform to recapture,
            about everything I felt free from in that mindset, performativity, gender expression, routine, yelling &
            whooping, taking in the acoustics of my echoes & making quips at my surroundings, speaking to people I
            pretend are camping in the dark trees, yelling at an asphalt factory, moment to moment to moment, no
            plan, loudly singing Job's Tears & Puppies by The Incredible String Band in a purposefully strained,
            cracking, croaking voice, walking deep into an alley then filling with inexplicable dread & laughing
            giddily as I sprint out for my life. Then skipping into the depths of the dark graveyard beatboxing
            loudly & aggressively, then loudly telling all the graves that I'm finally here to perform for them with
            my sporadic dances or by being a funny weirdo, either is applicable & I start punching through imaginary
            brick walls that I pretend are between me & the park, making explosion sounds, asserting that I'm
            punching through a billion walls, cycling through improvised mantras, growling, improvising the most
            frivolous & childish statements, trying to think of the freest thing I can do in each moment, repetitive
            motions & noises, kicking objects, the urge to write growing, my only tether home, the tension of the
            leash stretching, the release of description, trying to keep a growing paragraph together in my head as
            I go & go, punching the air going blau blau blau blau, lying on the sidewalk & seeing a city upside down
            for the first time in so long, dazzled by the validity of a perspective where I'm only clinging to the
            underside of the world, poised to grab onto the powerlines if I fall off. Stopping at the sink of a park
            pavilion to cover my arms & face in water & rub my slickened forearms together as I walk. On a picnic
            table someone had carefully written a long list of the first names of all the people in this city who
            had ever betrayed them, who they had once considered friends. Meanwhile, on another table, there was one
            of those hearts with two names, John & Becca, but it was beautiful, solid red shading with glitter, like
            an acrylic sort of thing, with a dark thick border, with lovingly rendered letters in overlapping green
            & orange. This shook me, & I didn't want to forget to write it down, so I spent a lot of the walk/run
            home repeating "lovingly rendered" out loud, over & over, lovingly rendered, lovingly rendered, lovingly
            rendered, lovingly rendered, sometimes switching to just lovingly, lovingly, lovingly, lovingly. As I
            pass all the graves again I yell that my mantra tonight is "lovingly rendered," that I hope their
            tombstones were all lovingly rendered but if they were mass manufactured because their loved ones didn't
            have the resources to make them themselves then at least they still had something & the orders for their
            gravestones were at least still lovingly rendered by their loved ones who had worked for money to afford
            them, & with the age of these graves maybe the ones who paid for their tombstones are even dead now, &
            who paid for those peoples' tombstones, did anyone pay for their own? Neither John nor Becca, whoever
            they are, has any idea that any of this happens. Breaking barriers alone, "breaking alone," I say,
            breaking alone breaking alone breaking alone
