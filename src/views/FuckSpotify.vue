                <p>
                    Let me be blunt: I used to play along with the whole Wrapped circus too.
                    I’d see everyone posting their little neon charts and think, “whatever,
                    it’s harmless, I won’t be the asshole who ruins the vibe.” But I’m done
                    with that. Fully done. I stopped using Spotify on New Year’s 2025 and
                    the second I stepped away, it was like, holy shit — why was I ever
                    defending this company?
                </p>

                <p>
                    So here it is without sugarcoating:
                    <strong>if you still use Spotify, stop.</strong>
                    You're not quirky. You're not “just having fun.” You're handing free
                    advertising and your own data to a company that has made it very clear
                    it doesn’t give a single fuck about music, musicians, or you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wrapped isn’t cute. Wrapped isn’t harmless. Wrapped is you doing PR for
                    a corporation that treats culture like garbage and reinvests your
                    subscription money into shit that has nothing to do with music.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reality is simple:
                    <strong>you can’t claim to care about music while shoveling money into
                        Spotify’s mouth.</strong>
                    They’ve shown their hand over and over:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>they underpay artists to a humiliating degree,</li>
                    <li>they flatten taste into algorithmic sludge for “engagement,”</li>
                    <li>and they funnel influence + resources toward surveillance,
                        border-enforcement propaganda, and fucking military tech.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    That’s not a glitch — that’s the business model. And I don’t want to be
                    part of it anymore. Neither should you.

                <h3>Spotify’s ICE Recruitment Ads</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2025, Spotify began running a series of
                    <strong>recruitment ads for ICE</strong>
                    (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement). Some of these ads referred
                    to “dangerous illegals” and framed ICE work as a heroic mission to
                    “protect America”. When immigrant communities, listeners, and
                    organisers pushed back, Spotify publicly stated that the ads did
                    <strong>not violate their advertising policy</strong> and continued to
                    run them.

                <p>
                    Whatever you think of ICE as an institution: this is not neutral. When
                    a music platform sells recruitment slots to an agency associated with
                    detention, deportation and family separation, it is
                    <strong>actively helping that machinery reproduce itself</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you see aggressive immigration enforcement as a form of
                    <strong>state terror against migrants</strong>, it is hard to avoid
                    the conclusion that
                    <strong>Spotify is monetising and amplifying that terror</strong>.

                <p>
                    In January 2025, during Donald Trump’s second inauguration,
                    <strong>Spotify hosted a high-profile inauguration brunch</strong> in
                    Washington, D.C. featuring Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro and others, and
                    contributed around
                    <strong>$150,000 to the official inauguration ceremony</strong> via
                    the Presidential Inaugural Committee.

                    Formally, this is “just” corporate political hospitality. In practice,
                    it means subscriber and advertising revenue are helping to
                    <strong>underwrite the spectacle and legitimacy of a hard-right
                        administration</strong> whose policies included the Muslim ban,
                    family-separation at the border, and open courting of nativist and
                    extremist movements.

                <p>
                    If you experience those policies as a form of
                    <strong>domestic political terror</strong>, you have to ask:
                    <strong>why is your music money in that room at all?</strong>

                <h3>Daniel Ek, Helsing and AI-Driven Warfare</h3>
                <p>
                    Parallel to Spotify’s growth, its CEO and co-founder
                    <strong>Daniel Ek</strong> has been pouring hundreds of millions of
                    euros into the European defence tech company
                    <strong>Helsing</strong> via his investment firm Prima Materia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Helsing develops <strong>AI software for militaries</strong>, designed
                    to analyse sensor and weapons-system data in real time and to power
                    autonomous or semi-autonomous weapons platforms. Recent reporting
                    notes that Helsing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        produces the <strong>HX-2 strike drone</strong> and other
                        unmanned systems,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        has supplied <strong>thousands of drones to Ukraine</strong> and
                        works with militaries in Germany, Sweden and the UK,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        is explicitly framed by Ek himself as part of a new paradigm where
                        “AI, mass and autonomy” are “driving the battlefield”.

                <p>
                    Officially, Helsing is separate from Spotify as a company. But
                    <strong>Ek’s power and wealth come directly from Spotify</strong>, and
                    he is using that power to accelerate the development and deployment of
                    AI-driven weapons systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you see drone warfare and algorithmic targeting as forms of
                    <strong>global state terror</strong>, then it becomes hard to pretend
                    that your monthly Spotify payment is “just about music”. At minimum,
                    it is part of an ecosystem where
                    <strong>money extracted from culture is reinvested into the
                        military-industrial complex</strong>.

                    <li>

                        Continuing to treat Spotify as a neutral cultural utility
